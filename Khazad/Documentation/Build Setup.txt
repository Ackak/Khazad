You should get these dependencies first:
  sdl + friends (just go into the package manager and install everything that looks like it belongs to sdl)
  libgl (mesa+libgl or working proprietary 3d drivers)
  freeglut
  guichan
  libmhash/mhash
  zlib/libz
  subversion (for getting code)
  codeblocks (for building it)
You'll also need the -dev packages for all this with the exception of subversion and codeblocks if you use a distro that separates them. 

Check out the code from svn:
  Start a terminal in your favorite 'bin' folder or your home folder
  Type in this command:
    svn co https://khazad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/khazad/Khazad khazad
  This will download the most actual version of khazad's source code. Note that this is *not* guaranteed to be stable in any way.

Once you have the code, you can build it using codeblocks:
  codeblocks --build khazad/Projects/Linux/CodeBlocks/Khazad.cbp

If all goes well, you'll have a Khazad binary in ./khazad

Updating goes like this - change into the khazad folder, issue a 'svn update' command and then 'codeblocks --rebuild Projects/Linux/CodeBlocks/Khazad.cbp'.
