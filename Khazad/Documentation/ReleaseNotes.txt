Release Notes v0.0.5

Khazad is still being built and just shows the static geometry of a map, major improvmenents in mouse control and Infterface have been implemented and the DF extractor is now more efficient and begining to grow into a flexible cross platform library well encalsulated and easily usable in other projects.

A new debugging output showing the Tile, Designation and Occupancy data taken directly from the map Extraction of the outlined cube at the center of the view, the Debugging output is now togglable with (b).

Fonts are now modable in the same way as texures, the Fonts.xml file defines the pathway for ttf fonts, the first font listed their will be used throughout the game, substitute your own fonts if desired.  Other Xml files have remained the same.

Extracted map files are now only a few hundred KB rather then several thousand due to the work of Dorf, old maps are naturally incompatible now and a new map (a fort of mine) is included.

The camera controls have changed a bit, ware as in previous version you pressed the right mouse to Tilt and Orbit the camera you now press the center mouse wheel (just prees down and hold without scrolling).  The left mouse now performs the new cursor-cube selection, each click on the map will move the cube their and a second click in the same tile will center the camera on that spot, pressing (c) will also center on the cursor cube.  The cubes xyz cordinates and data about the spot are displayed in the debugging output.

Screenshots can now be taken, pressing "PrtScr SysRQ" (PrintScreen SystemRequest) will save as screenshot in the ScreenShots folder, numbering is automatic starting with zero and shoots should not get overwritten.  The camera buttton on the UI also saves screenshoots.

Screenshoots of buggy or undesireable behaviors are welcome along with advice on ware the project should go.  A number of people are getting buggy behavior and I'm hoping to find more testers to help track down the source of these bugs, if someone with a reproducable bug can programm as well and try to track down a bug and its fix on their system that would be greatly appresiated.


Controls:

Keyboard controls:

c: Centers view to cursor
Up: Moves view up one level
Down: Moves view down one level

Insert: Increase number of viewing levels (lowers contrast between levels)
Delete: Decrease number of viewing levels (ingresses contrast between levels)

Left: Rotates camera view counterclockwise in small increments
Right: Rotates camera view clockwise in small increments

PageDown:  Incresses space between levels (will roll over if raised above 255)
PageUp: Decresses space between levels (can not go bellow 1)

d: Dumps memory from a running DwarfFortress game (this will update the current map if one is already active)
w: Writes current map to file
l: Loads an extracted map from file (also updates the current map if already active)
f: toggles the wirefram around the whole of the map and a single cube wireframe at the center of the view, on by default
h: toggles the viewing of hidden features such as underground pools, off by default
s: toggles shaddowed viewing mode, in shaddow mode the vertical depth of terrain is shown with by darkening it, in un-shaddowed mode all terrain is fully lite, off by default

v: Move into and lock vertical mode or unlock from vertical mode
b: Toggles Debugging output which now includes TileType, Designation and Occupancy flags extracted from DF

u: Toggles SubTerranean rendering
i: Toggles SkyView rendering
o: Toggles SunLit rendering

NEW OPTIONS! 


Mouse controls:

Left Click: Moves the Cursor cube to the clicked tile

ScrollwheelUp: Zooms view in
ScroolWheelDown: Zooms view out

Right Button down + horizontal mouse movement: pans camera view rightward/leftward
Right Button down + vertical mouse movement: advances/retreats camera view

Middle Button down + horizontal mouse movement: Rotates camera view clockwise/counterclockwise
Middle Button down + vertical mouse movement: Tilts camera view vertical/near-horizontal

ScrollwheelUp + SHIFT: Moves view up/down one level (same as Up/Down)
ScroolWheelDown + SPACEBAR: Increase/decresse number of viewing levels (same as Insert/Delete)

Known Issues:

- Expanding the window after the game has started will create a 'dead zone' outside of the original area of the screen ware mouse inputs will not work even though the mouse is movable and displays.  Using Fullscreen mode or just setting the Config for a very large screen area is the best work-around for now.

- Occational gaps in the map occure ware their should be some triangles rendered particularly on slopes ware it is nearly impossible to figure out what should fill jumbles of slope tiles but also in other odd in-explicable places usualy water.

- Memory footprint has improved but is still large, trying to load maps in excess of 8x8 might start to make your system crawl, experiment to see what your systems limits are.

- CPU Hog, Khazad is capped at 60 FPS using SDL_Delay but on many systems it will still use upwards of 99% of the processor when viewing a large area and might put too much stress on your system or video card, feedback is apresiated.  The FPS readout is based on the time that rendering itself took and frequently exceeds 60, when ever it dose your processer should go below 100% utilization.  At this point the readout is more theoretical then actual it represents the FPS you would be creating if Khazad weren't throttling back.

- Textures may be missing from the Material assignment system, fortunatly this is modable and anyone can edit their Textrue and Material xml files to re-assign any texture combination
