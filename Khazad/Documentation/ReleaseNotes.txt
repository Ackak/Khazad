Release Notes v0.0.1

Khazad is still being built and major sub-systems are still incomplete, buggy or just plain absent
The current release will show a randomly generated chunk of terrain like textured triangles with 
some square tiles one level above, all you can do is move the camera around this environment though
the next thing on the development plan is to make this terrain more interesting by importing it from DF
or have it be modified in real time.  An XML file config.xml allows the map dimensions to be altered and a few of the constants that determine how the camera is controlled, or for the program to run in full screen mode.

Their is a debugging output showing the Frame rate, feedback on what kind of rates people are getting with various types of hardware is appreciated.
