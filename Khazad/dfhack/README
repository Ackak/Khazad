Introduction
------------
DFHack is a Dwarf Fortress memory access library and a set of basic tools using this library.
The library is a work in progress, so things might change as more tools are written for it.

Getting DFHack
----------------
You can get the code or a release at DFHack's sourceforge site:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/dfhack/

* subversion access: 
  svn co https://dfhack.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dfhack/trunk dfhack 

Using the library
-----------------
The library should be compilable under Linux with GCC and under Windows with MinGW32
compiler. It is using the cmake build system. See COMPILE for details.

Main part of the API is in SimpleAPI.h
You might also have to include a few other files:
Types.h      - defines many of the used data structures
TileTypes.h  - functions for translating map tile type values to useful properties
               (wall, flooer, etc.)

Memory offset definitions
-------------------------

The file with memory offset definitions used by dfhack can be found in the output folder. 
TODO: write format explanation

Tools
-----
All the DFHack tools are terminal programs. This might seem strange to Windows users,
but they are meant mostly as examples for developers. Still, they can be useful and
are cross-platform just like the library itself.

* expbench   - just exports the map 1000 times over. Meant to test how fast the
               DFHack<->DF interface is. This should take 3-12 seconds.
               
* reveal     - plain old reveal tool. Demonstrates writing map data back to DF.

* prospector - scans the map for minerals. by default it only scans only visible veins.
               You can make it show hidden things with '-a' and base rock and soil layers
               with '-b'. These can be combined ('-ab')
               
* cleanmap   - cleans mud, vomit, snow and all kinds of bloody mess from the map. It will
               clean your irrigated farms too, so consider yourself warned.
